# Job Title: RFP Creative Solutions Specialist

## Initial Description

Our firm, Fuel Talent, often receives requests for proposals (RFPs) from our clients. These come from a wide variety of industries (transportation, entertainment, hospitality, finance, biotechnology, ...) but always relate to us providing software, data science, and AI services, from consulting, to recruiting, to complete project delivery. These RFPs are typical in that they provide background on the company, its needs, project scope, timelines, budgets, and legal (IP) terms. Our goal is to thoroughly analyze these RFPs, research the company and its market landscape for additional background/context to help generate insights, understand their specific needs as expressed in the RFP, research and generate creative ideas and solutions, formulate plans that meet the RFP needs and constraints, and ultimately generate a proposal (PDF) that has staffing, project descriptions, cost structures, and timelines, along with general background and evidence of our ability to credibly fulfill the demands of the proposal. Everything must be double-checked to ensure we have complied with the letter and spirit of the RFP and produced a compelling, innovative and standout proposal that is likely to win us the business.

We are looking for a Creative Solutions Expert to take analysis reports curated by the analyst to use with the RFP to brainstorm innovative solutions that meet the client's needs but also stands out in terms of creativity, efficiency, and novelty. The expected outcome would be a series of feasible, out-of-the-box ideas that best address the needs presented in the RFP (along with a few highly ambitious ideas that provide a north star and push the art of the possible).
